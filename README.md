The code is messy, but I will be working on it. 

Requirements found in the requirements.txt file.

$ py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

HOW TO EDIT THE .ENV FILE FOR THE TOKEN (Pre-made bot):

2. Locate your bot's token
3. Dry paste token into the .env file after the '=' sign with no space
4. Save and you're done
